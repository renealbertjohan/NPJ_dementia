
The script age_prediction is the script which was adjusted and optimized from the origial one. This script estimates RNA age taking as input the following:
- Predictor_Genes_Human: Provided by the software. It contains the set of genes with their respective  elastic net coefficients taken into account for RNAage calculation. 
- Counts_CPM_filtgenes: This comes from our dataset. It is the count matrix with reads converted to CPM from genes that are only present in the Predictor_Genes_Human set.
- Intercept : Constant value adjusted according to the dataset


The script also includes the correction of the RNAage estimation, to get the RNAage corrected, the script needs to set explicitly the following parameters:
-- median-age
-- sd-age
